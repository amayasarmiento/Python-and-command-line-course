$Python exam SDC 2024
========

$Open_frameDNA can take a DNA fasta file (.txt) and find the six possible reading frames.
Then it will count how many aminoacids are found in between start and stop codons. 
Next functionality is to be able to blast the protein sequence. 

The Following text will be updated when I figure how to make it do more! 


Look how easy it is to use:

    import Open_frameDNA
    # Get your stuff done
    project.do_stuff()

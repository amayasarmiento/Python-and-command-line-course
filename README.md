========

Open_frameDNA can take a DNA fasta file (.txt) and find the six possible reading frames.
Then it will count how many amino acids are found between start and stop codons. 
The next functionality would be to be able to blast the protein sequence. 


to use: version 2 will ask for the name of your DNA fasta-format text file; 
it will find the 6 orfs by sliding the translation window 
and it will give a summary of the amino acid count between start and stop codons. 

It does not count nested start-stops inside ORFs
